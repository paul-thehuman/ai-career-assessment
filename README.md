Setup Instructions
To set up and run this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

Node.js and npm (or Yarn) Installation:

Ensure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed. You can download them from nodejs.org.

Alternatively, you can use Yarn. Install it by following instructions on yarnpkg.com.

Create Project Directory:

Create a new folder for your project:

mkdir career-readiness-app
cd career-readiness-app

Create public and src folders:

mkdir public src

Create Files:

For src/App.js: Copy the content from the "Content for src/App.js" immersive block above. Open your Chromebook's text editor (e.g., "Text" app or a simple online editor), paste the code, and save the file as career-readiness-app/src/App.js.

For src/index.js: Copy the content from the "Content for src/index.js" immersive block above. Paste it into a new text file and save it as career-readiness-app/src/index.js.

For package.json: Copy the content from the "Content for package.json" immersive block above. Paste it into a new text file and save it as career-readiness-app/package.json.

For public/index.html: Copy the content from the "Content for public/index.html" section below. Paste it into a new text file and save it as career-readiness-app/public/index.html.

For README.md: Copy the content from this "Content for README.md" immersive block. Paste it into a new text file and save it as career-readiness-app/README.md.

Install Dependencies:

Navigate to your project's root directory in the terminal:

cd career-readiness-app

Install the required Node.js packages:

npm install
# or if you use Yarn
# yarn install

Running the Application
Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the application in development mode:

npm start
# or if you use Yarn
# yarn start

This will open the application in your web browser, usually at http://localhost:3000. The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.

Building for Production
To create a production-ready build of the application, run:

npm run build
# or if you use Yarn
# yarn build

This command builds the app for production to the build folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified and the filenames include hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!

Deployment
The build folder generated by npm run build contains all the static assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) needed to deploy your application. You can deploy this folder to any static site hosting service (e.g., Netlify, Vercel, Firebase Hosting, GitHub Pages, AWS S3).
